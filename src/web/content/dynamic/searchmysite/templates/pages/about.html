					<h2>About searchmysite.net</h2>

					<h3 id="what-is-different">What is different about this search engine?</h3>
					<p>
						searchmysite.net is an independent open source search engine and search as a service which:
						<ul>
							<li>
								<strong>Indexes only user-submitted sites</strong> 
								with a moderation layer on top, for a community-based approach to content curation, 
								rather than indexing the entire internet with all of its 
								spam, "search engine optimisation" and "click-bait" content.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Builds its own search index</strong> 
								for full and transparent control over results ranking, 
								rather than buying in results from other search engines like pretty much every other new search engine.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Does not show adverts and promotes advert-free results</strong> 
								pages, to remove the incentives for spam and surveillance capitalism.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Aims to have a sustainable and user-aligned operating model</strong>, 
								planning to pay running costs via a small listing fee (which gives access to additional benefits 
								such as the "search as a service" features, e.g. being able to trigger a reindex on demand), 
								rather than relying on advertising which could put it in conflict with user needs.
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Offers an unusually high level of privacy for a search engine</strong>, 
								thanks to the operating model which is not based on advertising or collecting personal 
								information for sale to advertisers (see the <a href="/pages/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a> for full details).
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Is fully open source</strong>, 
								for even greater transparency of the searching, ranking and indexing processes, 
								and for greater community involvement in improving the service. 
							</li>
							<li>
								<strong>Is easy to self-host</strong>, 
								allowing people to set up their own instances to search other parts of the internet, 
								opening up exciting new possibilities for search.
							</li>
							<li>
								This instance <strong>only searches personal and independent websites</strong>, 
								helping you find interesting and original content 
								which can be hard to find elsewhere nowadays.
							</li>
						</ul>
