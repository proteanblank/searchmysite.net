					<h3 id="faqs">Frequently asked questions</h3>

					<h5 id="what-types-of-site">What types of site can be submitted?</h5>
					<p>
						See the Submission Guidelines section in the <a href="/pages/terms/">Terms of Use</a> for information on what 
						types of site can be submitted.
					</p>

					<h5 id="how-do-i-add">How do I add a site that is not already listed?</h5>
					<p>
						Use the <a href="/admin/add/">Add Site</a> link at the top. There are two main options:
						Quick Add and Verified Add. The Quick Add lets anyone submit any site simply by entering the home page, although it needs
						to pass an approval process after submission before it is indexed. The Verified Add options can only be used by the site owner, 
						who needs to verify that they own the site.
					</p>

					<h5 id="how-do-i-verify">How do I verify ownership of a site?</h5>
					<p>
						The easiest way to prove ownership is to use <a href="https://indieweb.org/IndieAuth">IndieAuth</a>, but 
						if you don't have that set up you can still submit your site with a Domain Control Validation (DCV) 
						process similar to that which you may have used for other services,
						i.e. you upload a specific piece of content to the domain's root or TXT record. 
						The <a href="/admin/add/">Add Site</a> link will guide you through the process.
					</p>

					<h5 id="how-do-i-verify-already-listed">How do I verify ownership of an already listed site to access the verified owner benefits?</h5>
					<p>
						Use the <a href="/admin/add/">Add Site</a> link at the top and choose one of the Verified Add options described above.
					</p>

					<h5 id="how-do-i-check">How do I check on the status of a site I submitted via Quick Add?</h5>
					<p>
						Given there is no user tracking on Quick Add (see <a href="/pages/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>) 
						it isn't possible to notify you of changes to your submission directly. However, you can resubmit 
						the site and see what the message is, i.e. it is now being indexed, still pending review, or rejected 
						(along with rejection reason).
					</p>

					<h5 id="how-frequently">How frequently are sites reindexed?</h5>
					<p>
						At the moment, sites added via the Quick Add are reindexed weekly, and Verified Add are reindexed 
						twice weekly (verified owners can also trigger reindexes on demand). The <a href="/admin/add/quick/">Quick Add</a> 
						page has a summary of the differences.
					</p>



					<h3 id="query-syntax">Query syntax</h3>

					<p>
						<em>Individual words</em>: e.g. <strong>antarctica</strong>. If there are two words,
						e.g. <strong>antarctica book</strong>, it will search for them both but not as a phrase, and if 
						there are three or more words, e.g. <strong>book about antarctica</strong>, it will search for a minimum of 
						two of the words, e.g. in this example that could include pages with "book" and "about" but not "antarctica". 
					</p>

					<p>
						<em>Phrase search</em>: enclose phrase in double quotes to search for the exact phrase, 
						e.g. <strong>"book about antarctica"</strong>
					</p>

					<p>
						<em>Boolean search</em>: use AND, &&, NOT, !, OR, ||, + and -, with ( and ) to group queries, 
						e.g. for pages which contain the keywords antarctica and book use <strong>antarctica AND book</strong>, 
						or pages with antarctica and book but not movie use <strong>antarctica AND book !movie</strong>
					</p>

					<p>
						<em>Wildcard search</em>: * for multiple characters, and ? for single characters, e.g. <strong>*arctic*</strong>
					</p>

					<p>
						<em>Filters</em>: name:value, e.g. for all the pages on the michael-lewis.com domain which contain the word 
						antarctica use <strong>domain:michael-lewis.com AND antarctica</strong>, 
						or for all the article type pages on the michael-lewis.com domain use <strong>domain:michael-lewis.com AND page_type:article</strong>.
						See below for full list of field names.
					</p>

					<p>
						<em>Other searches</em>: e.g. fuzzy searches, proximity searches, range searches, boost, etc. see 
						<a href="https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/8_6/the-standard-query-parser.html">The Standard Query Parser</a>
						and <a href="https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/6_6/the-extended-dismax-query-parser.html">The Extended DisMax Query Parser</a>.

					<h3 id="indexing">Indexing</h3>

					<p>
						The indexing process respects the rules in robots.txt, so the indexing process begins by checking that file. 
						Indexing then progresses accordingly, normally starting with the home page and following links to other pages 
						within the same domain. The indexing process continues in a depth first manner until there are no further pages 
						to index or until the indexing page limit for the domain is reached.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you want to exclude certain pages from indexing, you would normally do this via robots.txt. Verified site 
						owners can in addition configure their listing to exclude content based on:
						<ul>
							<li>path: i.e. URLs containing a certain string.</li>
							<li>type: i.e. values from the page_type field described above.</li>
						</ul> 
						This might be useful to, for example, filter out micro blog entries which have a particular path or type. 
					</p>

					<h3 id="relevancy">Relevancy tuning</h3>

					<p>
						The following fields are used to determine how results are ranked:
						title, description, author, tags, url, content, indexed_inlink_domains_count, contains_adverts and owner_verified.
						There is further discussion of the relevancy tuning on some <a href="https://blog.searchmysite.net/">Blog</a> posts, 
						and of course the <a href="https://github.com/searchmysite/searchmysite.net">Source code</a> is available 
						for complete transparency.
					</p>

					<h3 id="api">API</h3>

					<p><!--
						OpenAPI Spec: <a href="https://searchmysite.net/api/v1/">https://searchmysite.net/api/v1/</a>
					--></p>
					<p>
						In summary, queries take the form /api/v1/search/&lt;domain&gt;?q=*, where parameters are:
						<ul>
							<li>&lt;domain&gt;: the domain being searched (mandatory)</li>
							<li>q: query string (mandatory)</li>
							<li>page: the page number which multi-page results should start from (optional, default 1)</li>
							<li>resultsperpage: the number of results per page (optional, default 10)</li>
						</ul>		
					</p>
					<p>
						Results are returned in the following format, with all fields optional apart from id and url (which will have the same value):
					</p>
					<pre><code>
{
  "params": {
    "q": "*",
    "page": 1,
